#style-select
Angular directive for a style-able, accessible select element.

This select is MOSTLY about the css.

##Usage
First, bring the script into your index page:

`<script scr="StyleSelectDirective.js"></script>`

There's a template for this directive, if you have it at the root level of your application you don't need to do anything, but if you place it inside another directory, you'll need to change the templateUrl inside the directive.

templateUrl: 'styleSelect.html',

To employ the select, insert an element (div is probably best) with the style-select attribute.*

<div style-select></div>



*To be accessible sites need to pass html validation, which means directives should be used as attributes with data-, not as elements.
